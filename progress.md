# Progress Tracking

## Week 2

**Frontend**
- **Jizheng**
  - Wrote database setup instructions
  - Brief spring overview with Encheng and Zihao
  - Read React basic tutorials
- **Anant**
  - I've begun reinforcing my knowledge of typescript syntax. In addition, I've set up the necessary resources and software for developing the front end such as Node.js. Further, I am familiarizing myself with the react framework since I’m responsible for partially implementing the product’s UI. Also have reviewed and merged the pull request for the frontend base project.

**Backend**
- **Encheng**
  - Learnt the basic of Spring. More precisely, Inversion Of Control (IOC) and Dependency Inject (DI). Spring will treat it as a blueprint of a class, which instead of we, programmers, repeatedly creating and constructing new class instances, IOC grants Spring the control over such object instance, in charge of constructing data values, and provide the object back to programmers. In addition, also learnt about how to add annotation to .xml file, then using @Autowired to link the object/function to the part where was annotated; using @Resource to achieve the same goal as @Autowired. Lastly, learnt how to let Spring use a package as the blueprint, @Component, which stores the constructing info about objects, allowing to call getBean(@param tag) to get the constructed object instance the same as the previous two approach.
- **Zihao**
  - Since I am responsible for the backend part of our project, and we are using Java with the Springboot framework, I went through the basic knowledge about Spring, to be specific, what is Spring, why it is a good choice, and how it benefits me and makes our project easier to establish. So, Spring is a framework for structuring J2EE systems based on IOC and AOP. Inversion Of Control is the basis of Spring. In short, IOC is the method of creating objects. Programmers do not need to create the object by the themselves (i.e. new Object()), but let Spring to create. Through dependency injection, we can directly get an object has been injected with the relevant properties. This makes our development much simpler.
Next week, I and Encheng will learn the basics of Springboot and also SQL.
