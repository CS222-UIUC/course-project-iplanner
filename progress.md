  - Since I am responsible for the backend part of our project, and we are using Java with the Springboot framework, I went through the basic knowledge about Spring, to be specific, what is Spring, why it is a good choice, and how it benefits me and makes our project easier to establish. So, Spring is a framework for structuring J2EE systems based on IOC and AOP. Inversion Of Control is the basis of Spring. In short, IOC is the method of creating objects. Programmers do not need to create the object by the themselves (i.e. new Object()), but let Spring to create. Through dependency injection, we can directly get an object has been injected with the relevant properties. This makes our development much simpler.
Next week, I and Encheng will learn the basics of Springboot and also SQL.
